Explanation: Only one operation can be performed, with score 1 + 1 = 2.

Test Case 2: Small Array with Identical Elements
Input: [2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two operations can be performed: (2+2) and (2+2), both with the score 4.

Test Case 3: 
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two operations with score 6: (5+1) and (2+4).

Test Case 4: All Elements Different but Possible to Have Same Score
Input: [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Possible operations all with score 5: (3+2), (1+4), (2+3).

Test Case 5: No possible operations
Input: [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two operations with score 8: (5+3) and (2+6).

Test Case 6: Array with Same Pairs
Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three operations possible with score 8: (4+4), (4+4), (4+4).

Test Case 7: Edge Case with Maximum Score Possible
Input: [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: Four operations possible with the maximum score of 2000: (1000+1000) repeated four times.

Test Case 8: Edge Case with All Elements the Same and Length Just Above Minimum
Input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two operations possible with score 14: (7+7) twice, leaving one element, so no more operations.
